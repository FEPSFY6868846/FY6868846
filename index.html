        The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnosis is having a growing impact in the healthcare industry offering 
        faster, more accurate diagnoses (through imaging and decision support systems). This article will investigate to what extent we can 
        rely on the efficiency and efficacy of AI in the healthcare industry, simultaneously addressing associated challenges such as systematic 
        biases that can be introduced, effecting outputs, alongside risks that arise due to a lack of procedure.

        Through a systematic review of recent studies and academic literature. This paper examines how AI is already being implemented, and the 
        capabilities AI has in reducing diagnostic time, providing more accurate analysis to assist healthcare professionals as well as improving 
        patient outcomes through artificial intelligence’s powerful data analysis ability allowing them to optimize the operations of a healthcare 
        facility benefiting both patients and doctors while ensuring reliability, effectiveness, and trust among healthcare professionals and patients.

    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
        While AI models used to cover 156 common conditions (Finley et al., 2018) can boast an average agreement rate of 90% (Zeltzer et al., 2023) 
        they can still face bias based on the data they were trained on (Eneanya et al., 2019) with one case where different races having different 
        baseline figures. For instance black patients tend to have a higher glomerular filtration rate (how efficiently the kidney can remove waste 
        from blood) than white patients resulting in increased diagnoses (Eneanya et al., 2019), as they both have to meet the same thresholds for 
        treatment for care resulting in delayed treatment (Eneanya et al., 2019). This is an issue that must be confronted before making such technology 
        commonplace ensuring an effective non-biased operation.
        
        Although a majority of NHS trusts still do not implement AI imaging, 12 AI imaging networks are being deployed covering 64 NHS trusts receiving 
        a total of £21million in funding (NHS AI Lab, n.d.), it is beginning to play an increasing role in our healthcare system (NHS AI Lab, n.d.).
        
        This paper will look into the use artificial intelligence as it develops. Analyzing perspectives from research papers and academic articles 
        discussing both sides of this technology. Firstly, it will asses the accuracy of AI models that are used to support diagnosis (Choi et al., 2020) 
        as well as taking analyzing their efficiency, including the benefits of choosing and incorporating AI models and how that will improve patient care 
        and satisfaction.

    <h3 id="analysis and discussion" style="margin-top: 45px;">Analysis and Discussion</h3>

    <h4 id="Accuracy" style="margin-top: 45px;">Accuracy</h4>
    <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
        In terms of accuracy AI models can greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy as the average agreement rate (the rate of which the Doctor and AI model
        gave the same diagnosis) is greater than or equal to 90% (Zeltzer et al., 2023), and after retraining for specific conditions, accuracy increased
        by 1.4% from 96.6% to 98% as (Zeltzer et al., 2023) found. This shows an AI models ability to improve over time as the model is trained on more 
        conditions and past test data (Zeltzer et al., 2023).
        
        As well as this Braun et al. (2020) highlights the large amount of uncertainty and bias in human diagnosis, evaluating that disagreeing human 
        second opinions tend to differ in the weighting of different factors and evaluation methods (Braun et al., 2020) which are human factors that 
        vary between doctors. Similarly, AI can face biases which are introduced when the model is trained, one example being Sample selection bias. 
        This is where the data it is trained on does not represent groups or individuals representatively, which in turn can create spurious correlations 
        (Srinivasan, Chandler, 2021). However this can be mitigated through careful evaluation and selection of data.
        
        In figure 2 Choi et al. (2020) compared the diagnostic accuracy of physicians vs an Artificial Intelligence-Clinical Decision Support System (AI-CDSS) 
        in diagnosing heart failure.

        Figure 2. Comparison of diagnostic accuracy between physicians and AI-CDSS across four classifications of heart failure, (Choi et al., 2020),
        
        Their results show a large gap in correct diagnosis rates with the AI-CDSS on average being 21.6% more accurate than a physician (Choi et al., 2020). 
        This evidence points to the fact that AI models can not only improve the accuracy diagnoses (Choi et al., 2020), but also that it will improve 
        and become more accurate over time as the AI model is trained on a more diverse dataset and that 90% agreement rate will only increase 
        (Zeltzer et al., 2023).
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h4 id="Efficiency" style="margin-top: 45px;">Efficiency</h4>
    <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
        The efficiency of AI models is another key point to assess, improved efficiency will not only mean quicker diagnosis but also improved patient 
        care as an earlier diagnosis means more immediate treatment where an increase in operational efficiency, referring to reduced waiting times, of 
        30% (Kasula, 2023)  shows the potential to massively improve efficiency in healthcare institutions.  Kasula (2023)  also recorded a 25% reduction 
        in diagnostic errors and a 20% increase in patient satisfaction scores (Kasula, 2023).
        
        This shows that implementing AI reduces time wasted through misdiagnoses, simultaneously improving the level of care for patients by offering 
        more individual treatment (Kasula, 2023). There are a few different methods that AI can be used to improve efficiency but the most common ones 
        involve optimizing treatment plans, allowing for more enhanced resource allocation (Zewail, Saber, 2023). It is important however to not over-rely
        on artificial intelligence as it may include biases that will go unnoticed due to its lack of transparency when providing 
        an output (Daneshjou et al, 2021). Therefore many people believe that AI should be used to aid decision making but ultimately leave responsibility 
        to the doctor (Fenech et al., 2018).
        
        They can also use advanced data analytics to detect early warning signs and identify patients who need immediate care, (Zewail, Saber, 2023) alongside 
        a streamlined treatment process making use of AI’s extreme processing capabilities (Kasula, 2023).

    <h3 id="Conclusion" style="margin-top: 45px;">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
        This paper investigated the reliability of the efficiency and efficacy of AI models in healthcare. The various papers examined all indicate an 
        improvement in overall efficiency and efficacy in the diagnosis of patients, providing a 20% more accurate evaluation that should be used to 
        help physicians develop diagnoses reducing any bias in the AI model, while providing better insights into patient care through optimal allocation 
        of resources within healthcare facilities with figures of up to 20% increase in patient satisfaction and 30% reduction in waiting times ultimately 
        indicating large gains in both efficacy and efficiency.
        
        Despite its potential, AI in the medical field still lacks many of the necessary standards, ethical guidelines and diverse training that should 
        be considered when using technology with the same potential impact. Therefore it requires more robust frameworks relating to a range of things 
        such as how the AI models are trained and what data they use, including how they and who has access to it, to how the outputs are evaluated and used 
        to form a final diagnosis.
        
        On balance even without these standards, the positive impact that artificial intelligence can have is undeniable and any benefits in such a crucial 
        industry should be explored cautiously but with optimism.
