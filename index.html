    <p class="ex1">
        The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnosis is having a growing impact in the healthcare industry offering faster, more accurate diagnosis’. This article will investigate to what extent we can rely on the efficiency and efficacy of AI in medical diagnosis, simultaneously addressing associated challenges such as bias’s that can be introduced alongside risks. Through a systematic review of recent studies and academic literature, this paper examines how AI is already being implemented, and the capabilities AI has in reducing diagnostic time, providing more accurate in depth analysis to assist physicians and doctors as well as improving patient outcomes through artificial intelligence’s powerful data analysis ability allowing them to optimize the operations of a healthcare facility benefiting both patients and doctors while remaining reliable, affective and trusted by everyone involved.

        You can describe mathematical expressions, equations, and symbols in a structured manner, which can  then  be  rendered  by  web  browsers,  assistive technologies,and  other  software  applications.
        Below  is  an  example  of  how  you  can  use  MathML  in  an  HTML  document  to  display  a  simple mathematical  expression.Presentation  of  MathML primarily  concentrates  on  the  visualisation  of mathematical  equations,  comprising  approximately  30  elements,  all  of  which  commence  with  the letter ‘m’.
        Some of the elements are listed below.
